# Shoe-store
<b>SPL: Assignment 2</b><br />
Java Concurrency and Synchronization<br /><br />

<h4><u>Description</u></h4><br />
Implemention of a simple shoe store using an implementation of a simple micro-service framework. The micro-services architecture has become quite
popular in recent years. In the micro-services architecture, complex applications are composed of
small, independent services which have the ability to communicate with each other using broadcastmessages
and requests. The micro-service architecture allows us to compose a large program from a
lot of small independant parts. This not only allows for better testability and much clearer seperation
of concerns, but it also allows to replace, add and remove different parts of the system without
breaking the system as a whole or even shutting it down.
